Here are the instructions for using this folder to generate a 
plot of the loss with respect to iterations. 

I am using this in order to visualize training and determine if I 
need to train with more iterations 

Instructions:
1. Create an empty file with the .csv extension to write data to

2. open jsonRead.py, and replace the file in main with the file to the
metrics json that is output from detectron train package. Should be found
in the output folder

3. Run jsonRead.py on that file only once, make sure to correctly include 
your csv file path in the CSVwrite function of jsonRead.py

4. Check your csv file to ensure everything has been written correctly

5. Next open the CSVread.ipynb jupyter notebook and change your csv file 
path to your correct csv file path. Then run all of the cells and view
the plots. You can change the fit function as you wish. i have included 3 
functions there
